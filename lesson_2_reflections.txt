What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You install git and ask it to keep track of changes made to files in a directory. You need to do it if you want Git to keep track of changes and help you out.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where you add files prior to being commited. The working directory and repository is the folder that has ALL of the files we're working with. 
Staging changes allows us to commit only certain files and exclude others if we don't want to commit them.
