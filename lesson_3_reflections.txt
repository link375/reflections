When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to keep files safe or when you're working remotely or want to backup your data in case of loss

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might have worked on the project and haven't pushed updates to github yet if it updated automatically you would lose your work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork: Lets you copy a repository and it's commits to your github account which you can then clone and modify
Clone: 1 to 1 copies of a repository including commits
Branches: Different features that hava been added to the code but should not be on the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So you can push it back up if it's been deleted or been tampered with
